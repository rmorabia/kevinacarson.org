# Biography

Kevin Carson is a senior fellow of the [Center for a Stateless Society](http://c4ss.org) and holds the Center's [Karl Hess Chair in Social Theory](http://c4ss.org/content/10370). Formerly a mutualist/individualist anarchist, he now identifies as an anarchist without adjectives. In addition to the classical individualists, he is influenced heavily by theorists of post-capitalism and commons-based peer production, Elinor Ostrom's natural resource governance theory, and autonomist Marxism. His written work includes *Studies in Mutualist Political Economy*, *Organization Theory: A Libertarian Perspective*, *The Homebrew Industrial Revolution: A Low-Overhead Manifesto*, and *The Desktop Regulatory State*, all of which are freely available to read below. Carson has also written for such print publications as *The Freeman: Ideas on Liberty* and a variety of internet-based journals and blogs, including *Just Things*, *The Art of the Possible*, the P2P Foundation, and his own [Mutualist Blog](http://mutualist.blogspot.com/).
